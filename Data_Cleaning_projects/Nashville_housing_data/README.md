# Introduction
This project aims to showcase or demonstrate my thought process while cleaning dirty datasets.
- Database and tables were created solely from scratch though use of VSCode (Postgres connection)
- Datasets were provided from [Github: Alex The Analyst](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx)
All codes will be listed within the folder here [sql_queries](C:\Users\Haiza\Desktop\Portfolio\Data_Cleaning_projects\Nashville_housing_data\sql_queries)
