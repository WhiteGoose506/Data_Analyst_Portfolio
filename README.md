## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to the **EDA section** of my Data Analytics portfolio!  
This space is dedicated to projects that highlight my ability to **explore datasets, uncover patterns, and generate insights**.  

---

### 🔍 What You’ll Find Here
- **EDA Projects** – Beginner-level analysis of datasets  
- **Thought Process** – How I approach identifying trends and relationships  
- **Problem-Solving** – Using data exploration to answer meaningful questions

### 🛠 My EDA Workflow
While **Data Cleaning** and **Visualization** are stored in their own dedicated folders, EDA often touches on them as part of the process:  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – discovering distributions, trends, and correlations  
2. **Initial Visualizations** – supporting findings with charts where helpful

### 💻 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** (primary focus for queries and analysis)  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn)** – expanding usage in ongoing projects  
- **R (Tidyverse)** – for additional statistical exploration  

---

### 🎯 Goal
Through these EDA projects, I aim to:  
- Strengthen my analytical thinking  
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets  
- Build a foundation that supports advanced analysis and data-driven decision-making
